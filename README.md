I like to find the best ways to fix things. When it comes to computer work, at least, I don't do it for money. I have very little special training (in this field), but I love to learn, to teach, and to help.

Look through my [repos](https://github.com/therealchjones?tab=repositories) if you wish. My (current, fleeting, vague, and poorly directed) areas of interest:

- [C#](https://github.com/topics/csharp)
- [Google Apps](https://github.com/topics/google-apps)/[Google Workspace](https://github.com/topics/google-workspace)/[Gsuite](https://github.com/topics/gsuite) (especially [Google Sheets](https://github.com/topics/google-sheets)) & [Google Apps Script](https://github.com/topics/google-apps-script)
- [POSIX](https://github.com/topics/posix)
- [Python](https://github.com/topics/python)
- [reverse engineering](https://github.com/topics/reverse-engineering) (including [Android](https://github.com/topics/android), [assembly](https://github.com/topics/assembly), [C](https://github.com/topics/c), and [Unity](https://github.com/topics/unity))
- [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/topics/vscode)
